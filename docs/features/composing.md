# Composing Emails

Aerion includes a full-featured email composer with rich text editing capabilities.

## Starting a New Message

- Click the **Compose** button in the toolbar
- Press `Ctrl+N` from anywhere in the app
- Click **Reply**, **Reply All**, or **Forward** on a message
- Press:
    - `Ctrl+R` - Reply
    - `Ctrl+Shift+R` - Reply All
    - `Ctrl+F` - Forward

## The Composer Interface

The composer includes:

- **From** - Select which account/identity to send from
- **To** - Primary recipients
- **Cc/Bcc** - Click to show additional recipient fields
- **Subject** - Email subject line
- **Body** - Rich text editor for your message
- **Toolbar** - Formatting options and actions

## Rich Text Editor

The composer uses a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor powered by [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/).

### Text Formatting

| Format | Toolbar | Keyboard |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Bold | **B** button | `Ctrl+B` |
| Italic | *I* button | `Ctrl+I` |
| Underline | U button | `Ctrl+U` |
| Strikethrough | ~~S~~ button | - |

### Structure

- **Headings** - H1, H2, H3 heading levels
- **Bullet Lists** - Unordered lists
- **Numbered Lists** - Ordered lists
- **Blockquotes** - Quoted text blocks
- **Code Blocks** - Monospace code formatting
- **Horizontal Rule** - Divider line

### Links

1. Select the text you want to link
2. Click the link button in the toolbar
3. Enter the URL
4. Click Apply

### Tables

1. Click the table button in the toolbar
2. Select the table size
3. The table will be inserted at the cursor position

Edit tables using the table tools that appear when a table is selected.

###  Toolbar

From the subject field, if you press tab, it will automatically focus on the body of the e-mail which effectively skips the toolbar. To focus on the toolbar, press `Alt+T` and single key shortcut key hints will displayacross the toolbar for you to select a button with keyboard. To exit toolbar mode, simply press `Alt+T` again.

## Plain Text Mode

Toggle to plain text mode when you need:

- Simpler formatting
- Better compatibility with older email clients
- Smaller message size

Click the **Plain Text** toggle in the toolbar to switch modes.

:::warning
Switching from rich text to plain text will remove all formatting.

## Attachments

### Adding Attachments

Three ways to attach files:

1. **Click to Attach** - Click the attachment button and select files or press `Alt+A`
2. **Drag and Drop** - Drag files onto the composer window
3. **Paste Images** - Copy an image and paste directly into the editor

### Attachment Limits

Attachment size limits depend on your email provider:

| Provider | Typical Limit |
|----------|---------------|
| Gmail | 25 MB |
| Outlook | 20 MB |
| Most providers | 10-25 MB |

For larger files, consider using a file sharing service and including a link.

## Recipients

### Autocomplete

As you type in the To, Cc, or Bcc fields:

- Matching contacts from your synced address books appear
- Recent recipients are suggested
- Select a suggestion with arrow keys and Enter

### Multiple Recipients

- Separate multiple addresses with commas
- Each recipient appears as a "chip" that can be removed individually

### Cc and Bcc

Click **Cc** or **Bcc** to show these fields:

- **Cc (Carbon Copy)** - Visible to all recipients
- **Bcc (Blind Carbon Copy)** - Hidden from other recipients

## Drafts

### Auto-Save

Aerion automatically saves your draft as you compose. If you close the composer or the app unexpectedly, your draft will be preserved.

Drafts are saved to your email account's Drafts folder.

### Resuming Drafts

To continue working on a draft:

1. Navigate to the Drafts folder
2. Click on the draft to view it in the conversation viewer
3. Click  the **Pencil icon** on the top right corner of the draft inside the conversation viewer to open it in the composer

## Pop-Out Composer

Detach the composer to a separate window:

- Click the **Pop Out** button in the composer toolbar
- Press `Ctrl+D`

This allows you to:
- Reference other emails while composing
- Keep the composer open while navigating
- Position the composer on a different monitor

## Sending

When ready to send:

- Click the **Send** button
- Press `Ctrl+Enter`

The message will be sent through your email provider's SMTP server.

### Send Confirmation

After sending, a brief confirmation appears. If sending fails, you'll see an error message with details.

## Signatures

Set up signatures for each account identity:

1. Go to **Settings > Accounts**
2. Click **Edit** on an account
3. Navigate to the **Identities** section
4. Edit the signature in the rich text editor
5. Save changes

Signatures are automatically appended when composing new messages.

### Per-Identity Signatures

If you have multiple identities (email addresses) on one account, each can have its own signature.
