# Introduction

Aerion is an open source, lightweight email client built for people who want a modern email experience without the bloat.

## Why Aerion?

The Linux desktop has long needed a proper email client. The existing options each have their drawbacks:

- **Thunderbird** - Clunky interface with too much legacy baggage
- **Geary** - Crippled by its dependency on Gnome Online Accounts, and search is unreliable
- **Mailspring** - Built on Electron, which means heavy resource consumption
- **Evolution** - Feels like it's still stuck in 1999

Aerion was created to fill this gap: a standalone, lightweight email client with a modern interface that just works.

## Design Goals

Aerion is built around five core principles:

1. **Resource Efficiency** - Minimal CPU, RAM, and battery consumption
2. **Modern UX** - Clean, intuitive interface with dark mode support
3. **Keyboard & Mouse Friendly** - Full keyboard navigation with vim-style shortcuts
4. **Independence** - No dependency on Gnome Online Accounts or other system services
5. **Search That Works** - Basic search that actually finds your emails

## Technology

Aerion is built with [Wails](https://wails.io) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), not Electron. This means native performance with a modern web-based UI, without the memory overhead of running a full Chromium instance.

## Platform Support

While Linux is a first-class citizen, Aerion also runs on:

- **Linux** - AppImage for easy installation
- **macOS** - Native .app bundle
- **Windows** - Standard installer

Some system-level features like clickable notifications and auto-sync on wake are currently Linux-only.
