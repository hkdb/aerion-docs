# Verifying Your Installation

After installation, launch Aerion. You'll first see a Terms and Privacy acceptance modal. After accepting, you can add your first email account by clicking the **+ Add Account** button in the sidebar.

If you encounter any issues, check the [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting) guide.

## Next Steps

Now that Aerion is installed, proceed to [First Account Setup](./first-account/index.md) to add your email account.
