# Gmail Setup

Aerion supports Gmail through two authentication methods: OAuth (recommended) and App Passwords.

## OAuth Method (Recommended)

OAuth is the easiest and most secure way to connect your Gmail account.

### Steps

1. Click **Sign in with Google**
2. A browser window will open to Google's sign-in page
3. Sign in to your Google account
4. Review the permissions and click **Allow**
5. Return to Aerion and click **Add Account**

### Permissions Requested

Aerion requests the following permissions:
- **Read, send, and manage your email** - Required for basic email functionality
- **View your contacts** - Used for email address autocomplete

### Security Note

You may see a warning that "This app isn't verified." This is normal for open-source applications that haven't gone through Google's verification process. Aerion is safe to use - you can verify this by reviewing the [source code](https://github.com/hkdb/aerion).

To proceed:
1. Click **Advanced**
2. Click **Go to Aerion (unsafe)**
3. Review permissions and click **Allow**

## App Password Method (Alternative)

Use this method if:
- OAuth doesn't work in your environment
- Your organization restricts OAuth applications
- You prefer using app-specific passwords

### Prerequisites

You must have 2-Step Verification enabled on your Google account to use app passwords.

### Creating an App Password

1. Go to your [Google Account Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Under "How you sign in to Google," click **2-Step Verification**
3. Scroll down and click **App passwords**
4. Select **Mail** and **Other (Custom name)**
5. Enter "Aerion" as the name
6. Click **Generate**
7. Copy the 16-character password shown

### Adding to Aerion

1. Click **+ Add Account** in the sidebar (or go to **Settings > Accounts > Add Account**)
2. Select **Gmail** from the provider dropdown
3. Choose the **App Password** authentication method
4. Enter your Gmail address
5. Paste the app password you generated
6. Click **Add Account**

## Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" Error

- Ensure you've authorized the correct Google account
- Try generating a new app password
- Check if your organization has restrictions on third-party apps

### OAuth Token Expired

OAuth tokens periodically expire. To re-authorize:

1. Go to **Settings > Accounts**
2. Click **Edit** on your Gmail account
3. Click **Re-authorize**
4. Complete the OAuth flow again

### Sync Issues

If emails aren't appearing:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Select the folder, click the sync icon, and choose **Force Re-sync**
3. Verify your account is still authorized in [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)

## Contact Sync

When you authorize Gmail with OAuth, Aerion can also sync your Google Contacts for email autocomplete. This is configured separately in **Settings > Contacts**.

See [Contacts](/docs/features/contacts) for more information.
