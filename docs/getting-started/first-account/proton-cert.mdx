In order to use Proton Bridge with Aerion, you must first install the certificate on your system. If you are unsure how to accomplish this, follow the below steps.


1. Open Proton Bridge
2. Click on the gear icon to go to the settings screen
3. Click on `Advanced settings` at the bottom to expand Proton Bridge advanced settings
4. Look for `Export TLS certificates` and click the `Export` button next to it.
5. Save the file (cert.pem) to a safe location
7. From the terminal, cd into the location of `cert.pem` and install it to:

    - Arch based systems:
      ```base
      sudo cp cert.pem /etc/ca-certificate/trust-source/anchor/proton-bridge.pem
      sudo update-ca-trust
      ```    
    - Debian based systems:
      ```bash
      sudo cp cert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/proton-bridge.crt
      sudo update-ca-certificates
      ```
    - Redhat based systems:
      ```bash
      sudo cp cert.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/proton-bridge.pem
      sudo update-ca-trust
      ```
    - Void Linux:
      ```bash
      sudo cp cert.pem /etc/ssl/certs/proton-bridge.pem
      sudo update-ca-certificates
      ```

This will make it so that any software on your system will now recognize the Proton Bridge cert as a valid SSL certificate.
