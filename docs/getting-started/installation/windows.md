## Community Maintained Packages

### Chocolatey

https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/aerion

This is an unofficial package maintained by [@Infiniti151](https://github.com/Infiniti151). For any issues, please submit a Github issue directly to the [Infiniti151/aerion-chocolatey](https://github.com/Infiniti151/aerion-chocolatey) project.

Standard:

This pulls down the native setup utility, handles programmatic configuration, and hooks seamlessly into Windows Apps & Features.

```bash
choco install aerion
```

Portable:

This downloads the raw, uncompressed execution binary directly into your localized Chocolatey application sandbox. It keeps your Windows registry completely untouched and instantly configures a global CLI command-line shortcut shim so aerion can be called from any terminal session immediately.

```bash
choco install aerion.portable
```
